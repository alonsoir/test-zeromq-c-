git commit -m "Day 52: Fix etcd-client compression header extraction

- Added 4-byte header extraction before decompression
- Validates minimum size (4 bytes header + data)
- Validates decompressed size sanity (<100MB)
- Matches compress() format: [4-byte-size][compressed_data]
- Backup created: etcd_client.cpp.backup.day52

Testing:
- 200 events processed with 0 crypto/decompression errors
- Pipeline validation: 7532 bytes → 3779 compressed → 3819 encrypted
- Compression ratio: 50.1% (excellent for JSON)

Known issues discovered:
- BatchProcessor uses hardcoded 'ml_defender_blacklist' ipset name
- Logger writes to hardcoded path vs config path
- Workaround: created missing ipset manually

Results: 209 IPs blocked, 4 successful batch flushes"
