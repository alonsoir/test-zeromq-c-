Day 57: Emergency restoration of etcd-client after Day 54 regression

CRITICAL BUG FIXED: Day 54 HMAC refactoring accidentally deleted core
etcd-client implementation methods and introduced duplicated namespace
declarations across multiple files. System compiled but would fail at
runtime due to missing http::put() and related functions.

Root Cause Analysis:
- Day 54 removed internal crypto/compression from etcd-client
- Refactoring accidentally deleted namespace http from public header
- http::put/get/post/del implementations existed but weren't exported
- Duplicate declarations in 3 files caused linker ambiguity
- Pre-Day-54 library still installed, masking the source code bug

Recovery Actions (4 hours systematic debugging):
1. Discovered source code (128 lines) != installed library (1.1M)
2. Found backup etcd_client_fixed.cpp with complete implementation
3. Cleaned duplicate namespace http declarations from 3 files
4. Added namespace http to public header with all function signatures
5. Fixed CMakeLists.txt (removed GTest test, cleaned dependencies)
6. Refactored root Makefile with proper clean-libs target
7. Synchronized function signatures (removed duplicate default params)

Files Modified:
- Makefile: Added clean-libs, clean-all, improved verify-all
- etcd-client/CMakeLists.txt: Removed duplicate test definition
- etcd-client/tests/CMakeLists.txt: Disabled GTest test, updated summary
- etcd-client/include/etcd_client/etcd_client.hpp: Added namespace http (48 methods)
- etcd-client/src/http_client.cpp: Removed duplicate Response struct
- etcd-client/src/etcd_client.cpp: Removed duplicate namespace http forward decls

Verification Results:
✅ etcd-client library: 1.0M, 48 public methods
✅ All 4 components link correctly to libetcd_client.so.1
✅ HMAC tests: 12/12 PASSED
✅ Encryption tests: 6/6 PASSED
✅ Linkage verification: PASSED
❌ Compression tests: FAILED (pre-existing LZ4 bug - separate issue)

Known Issues (Not Introduced by This Commit):
- crypto-transport LZ4 decompression bug (fix scheduled Day 58)
- test_etcd_client_hmac_grace_period uses GTest (disabled, non-critical)
- Component configs show null for encryption flags (needs review Day 58)

Next Steps (Day 58+):
1. Fix crypto-transport LZ4 bug (PRIORITY 1 - blocking)
2. Review component encryption/compression configs
3. Continue HMAC integration: firewall-acl-agent → CSV + HMAC
4. Implement rag-ingester etcd-client integration
5. End-to-end pipeline testing

Lessons Learned:
- Always diff source vs installed library before make install
- Run complete test suite after major refactorings
- Keep explicit backups before destructive changes
- Piano piano: validate each step incrementally
