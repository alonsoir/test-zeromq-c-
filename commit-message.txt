git commit -m "feat(secrets): Integrate SecretsManager with grace period support (Day 55)

COMPLETE INTEGRATION:
- Fixed namespace mismatch: etcd:: → etcd_server::
- Integrated SecretsManager with EtcdServer via set_secrets_manager()
- Implemented 4 functional /secrets/* HTTP endpoints
- Added basic test suite (4/4 tests passing)

ENDPOINTS IMPLEMENTED:
- GET /secrets/{component} - Get active HMAC key
- POST /secrets/rotate/{component} - Rotate key with grace period
- GET /secrets/valid/{component} - Get all valid keys (active + grace)
- GET /secrets/keys - API documentation

GRACE PERIOD VERIFIED:
- 300s configurable grace period
- Old keys remain valid during rotation
- Tested with curl and automated tests
- Zero-downtime key rotation ready

TESTS:
✅ test_secrets_manager_simple: 4/4 PASS
  - Generate and get HMAC key
  - Rotation with grace period
  - Grace period expiry
  - Configuration validation
