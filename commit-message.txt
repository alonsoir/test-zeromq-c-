Day 36 Planning: Architectural gap discovered, pragmatic solution designed

DISCOVERY:
- Feature extraction systems disconnected (83/40 feat extractors vs 11 fields in .pb)
- Detection system: FUNCTIONAL ✅ (20+ hours stable)
- RAG/FAISS pipeline: INCOMPLETE ❌ (embedders expect 83, .pb has 11)
- Tag "requires_processing" was there - we knew something was missing

ROOT CAUSE:
- Fast iteration = parallel development without integration
- Two feature systems evolved separately (CTU-13 legacy + ML Defender real-time)
- End-to-end testing with real data pipeline skipped
- BACKLOG.md not maintained = lost track of TODOs

IMPACT:
- Detection: NONE (system works perfectly)
- FAISS: BLOCKING (cannot train PCA with incomplete features)
- Timeline: +1 day (but double validation benefit)

SOLUTION: Plan A→B→A'
- Day 36: Train PCA with synthetic (validates architecture)
- Day 37: Fix feature processing (40 or 83 features in .pb)
- Day 38: Re-train PCA with real data (validates fix)
- Net: Foundation tested twice, not rushed once

DOCUMENTATION:
+ TECHNICAL_DEBT_DAY36.md (comprehensive analysis)
+ BACKLOG_UPDATE_DAY36.md (roadmap adjustments)
+ PROMPT_CONTINUE_CLAUDE_DAY36.md (Day 36 execution guide)

VIA APPIA REFLECTION:
Good: Discovered during planning (not production)
Good: Detection system solid, no prod impact
Good: Pragmatic solution designed
Bad: Lost track of integration debt
Bad: "requires_processing" left as TODO without follow-up
Bad: BACKLOG.md not maintained properly
