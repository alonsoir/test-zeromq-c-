feat(security): Day 53 - HMAC Infrastructure for Log Integrity (FASE 1 + FASE 2)

COMPLETE: Military-grade log integrity protection via HMAC-SHA256

## FASE 1: etcd-server SecretsManager

### New Components
- SecretsManager class with HMAC-SHA256 key generation (libsodium)
- Thread-safe key storage with mutex protection
- Auto-generation of /secrets/rag/log_hmac_key on startup
- Key rotation with version tracking
- Statistics tracking (generated/rotated/accessed)

### HTTP Endpoints (3)
- GET  /secrets/keys         - List all secret keys
- GET  /secrets/*            - Get specific key (hex-encoded)
- POST /secrets/rotate/*     - Rotate specific key

### Tests (16/16 ✅)
- 12/12 unit tests (SecretsManager operations)
- 4/4 integration tests (end-to-end workflow)

### Files Modified/Created (10)
- include/etcd_server/secrets_manager.hpp (new)
- src/secrets_manager.cpp (new)
- src/main.cpp (initialize SecretsManager)
- src/etcd_server.cpp (3 HTTP endpoints + include)
- include/etcd_server/etcd_server.hpp (SecretsManager pointer)
- config/etcd-server.json (secrets configuration)
- CMakeLists.txt (OpenSSL dependency)
- tests/test_secrets_manager.cpp (new)
- tests/test_hmac_integration.cpp (new)
- tests/CMakeLists.txt (new test targets)

## FASE 2: etcd-client HMAC Utilities

### New Methods (5)
- get_hmac_key()        - Retrieve HMAC key from etcd-server
- compute_hmac_sha256() - Generate HMAC (OpenSSL)
- validate_hmac_sha256() - Constant-time validation
- bytes_to_hex()        - Hex encoding utility
- hex_to_bytes()        - Hex decoding utility

### Tests (16/16 ✅)
- 12/12 unit tests (HMAC operations)
- 4/4 integration tests (etcd-server interaction)

### Files Modified/Created (6)
- include/etcd_client/etcd_client.hpp (HMAC section)
- src/etcd_client.cpp (HMAC implementations + OpenSSL includes)
- CMakeLists.txt (OpenSSL dependency + include dirs)
- tests/test_hmac_client.cpp (new)
- tests/test_hmac_integration_client.cpp (new)
- tests/CMakeLists.txt (new test targets)

## Security Features
- 32-byte HMAC-SHA256 keys (256-bit security)
- Constant-time HMAC validation (timing attack prevention)
- Secure key generation (libsodium random)
- Secure key deletion (sodium_memzero)
- Key rotation with audit trail
- Thread-safe operations

## Integration Impact
ALL components using etcd-client now have HMAC support:
- ml-detector (can generate HMAC for detections)
- sniffer (can generate HMAC for logs)
- rag-ingester (ready for HMAC validation - FASE 3)
- firewall-acl-agent (can validate HMAC for rules)

## Test Results
- Unit tests:        24/24 ✅
- Integration tests: 8/8 ✅
- Coverage:          100% ✅

## Via Appia Quality
Piano piano approach: FASE 1 complete → FASE 2 complete → FASE 3 next
Each phase fully tested before advancing.

## Next Phase
FASE 3: rag-ingester EventLoader HMAC validation
- Add HMAC validation before decryption
- Reject tampered logs
- Metrics + alerting for tampering attempts
