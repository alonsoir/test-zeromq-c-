git commit -m "Day 36: PCA Embedder Pipeline Complete + Thread-Local Bug Documented

✅ PCA Pipeline Complete:
- 3 Python scripts: generate → train → convert
- Synthetic data: 100K samples × 102 features
- PCA model: 102 → 64 dims (64% variance)
- ONNX export: pca_embedder.onnx (28 KB, 1.08μs transform)
- Ready for FAISS integration

🐛 Thread-Local Bug Identified:
- Root cause: cross-thread FlowManager access
- Impact: Only 11/102 features captured in .pb files
- Workaround: PCA trained for full 102-feature schema
- Fix: Postponed for next week (single-threaded → hash routing)
- Documentation: Complete root cause analysis

📋 Via Appia Quality:
- Investigated thoroughly before fixing
- Documented exhaustively for future
- Temporary solution now, proper fix later
- .proto is THE LAW - trained for complete schema

Next: FAISS integration with synthetic PCA (Day 37-38)
Future: Re-train PCA with real data (85-95% variance expected)"
