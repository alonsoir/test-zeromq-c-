# ML Defender - Vision Document
## Security as a Right, Not a Privilege

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** October 26, 2025  
**Status:** Vision / Pre-Product

---

## Executive Summary

ML Defender is an open-source, ML-powered network security system designed to democratize enterprise-grade protection. From datacenter servers processing 100K events/second to Raspberry Pi devices protecting home networks, the same codebase, same models, and same principles apply: **security should be accessible, transparent, and respectful of privacy**.

This document captures the vision for productizing ML Defender as both:
1. **Open-source software** (DIY installation)
2. **Hardware appliance** (plug-and-play box)

Both share identical code, verification systems, and update mechanisms. Both embody the same values: transparency, privacy, and user control.

## The Problem

### Current State of Endpoint/Edge Security

**For Enterprises:**
- Solutions cost $30-60 per endpoint per month
- Closed-source, black-box implementations
- Heavy resource consumption (500MB-2GB RAM)
- Cloud dependency for basic functionality
- Opaque telemetry and data collection

**For Individuals:**
- Linux users largely unprotected
- IoT devices (30+ billion globally) have minimal security
- Available solutions are either:
    - Too expensive ($20-50/month per device)
    - Too complex (DIY firewall rules)
    - Too invasive (require cloud, collect everything)
    - Or don't exist at all for Linux desktop

**The Gap:**
There is no solution that is simultaneously:
- ✅ High-performance (ML-powered)
- ✅ Privacy-respecting (on-device processing)
- ✅ Transparent (open source, auditable)
- ✅ Affordable (accessible to everyone)
- ✅ Lightweight (works on $35 hardware)

## Our Solution

### Technical Architecture

**Core Pipeline:**
```
[Kernel Space - eBPF/XDP]
  ↓ Hybrid filtering (60-90% dropped in kernel)
[User Space - C++20 Sniffer]
  ↓ Feature extraction
[ML Detector - ONNX Runtime]
  ↓ Multi-level inference (4 stages)
[Output]
  ↓ Alerts, blocks, or logs
```

**Resource Footprint:**
- Sniffer: 4-10 MB RAM, <2% CPU
- ML Detector: 150-200 MB RAM, 5-15% CPU
- **Total: ~200 MB RAM, ~20% CPU**

This efficiency enables deployment on:
- Enterprise servers (100K+ events/sec)
- Desktop Linux machines (100-1000 events/sec)
- Raspberry Pi / Edge devices (10-100 events/sec)

**Key Technologies:**
- eBPF/XDP for kernel-level filtering (Linux advantage)
- C++20 for zero-copy, high-performance processing
- ONNX Runtime for cross-platform ML inference
- Protocol Buffers for efficient serialization
- ZeroMQ for low-latency messaging

## Core Values & Principles

### 1. Privacy by Default

**What This Means:**
- All ML inference happens on-device
- No cloud dependency for core functionality
- User data never leaves their network
- Telemetry is opt-in, not opt-out

**Implementation:**
```python
{
  "telemetry": {
    "enabled": false,  # DEFAULT: OFF
    "what_we_collect": [
      "Attack type counts (aggregated)",
      "Model performance metrics",
      "Resource usage statistics"
    ],
    "what_we_never_collect": [
      "❌ IP addresses",
      "❌ Packet contents",
      "❌ User identifiers",
      "❌ Network topology"
    ]
  }
}
```

### 2. Transparency Through Open Source

**What This Means:**
- Core software is AGPLv3 licensed
- All code is auditable on GitHub
- Build process is documented and reproducible
- Security researchers can (and should) audit

**Verification System:**
- Users can verify binary integrity anytime
- SHA256 hashes published on multiple sources (GitHub, IPFS, website)
- Automated daily verification checks
- Community can reproduce builds

```bash
# Any user, anytime:
sudo ml-defender verify

# Output shows:
# ✅ All components match official hashes
# ✅ Verified against GitHub, IPFS, official site
```

### 3. User Control is Sacred

**What This Means:**
- Users can disable any feature
- No dark patterns or hidden settings
- Clear explanations for every permission
- Easy to uninstall without traces

**Examples:**
- Telemetry requires explicit consent during setup
- Auto-updates can be disabled (with warnings)
- All data retention policies are user-configurable
- Export/delete all data with one command

### 4. Performance Matters

**Why:**
- Security that slows you down won't be used
- Must work on $35 hardware (accessibility)
- Energy efficiency matters (environmental impact)

**Targets:**
- RAM: <200 MB total
- CPU: <20% on dual-core ARM
- Latency: <1ms per event
- Throughput: 100+ events/sec on RPi

### 5. Accessibility for All

**Financial:**
- Free open-source option available
- Hardware box affordable ($149 vs $500+ competitors)
- No recurring fees for basic protection
- Bulk discounts for non-profits

**Technical:**
- 2-minute setup for non-technical users
- Extensive documentation for advanced users
- Support available in multiple languages (future)
- Accessible UI following WCAG guidelines

## Technical Deep Dive

### eBPF/XDP Filtering Strategy

**Why This Matters:**
Traditional packet capture sends ALL packets to userspace. With eBPF/XDP, we can:
- Filter 60-90% of packets in kernel space
- Reduce userspace processing by 10-100x
- Lower CPU usage from ~50% to ~5%
- Enable deployment on low-power devices

**Implementation:**
```c
// Kernel space (eBPF)
if (port_is_excluded(dport)) {
    return XDP_DROP;  // Drop in kernel, never reaches userspace
}
if (port_is_included(dport) || default_action == CAPTURE) {
    return XDP_PASS;  // Send to userspace for ML analysis
}
```

**Platform Strategy:**
- Linux: Native eBPF/XDP (100% performance)
- Windows: WFP (Windows Filtering Platform) - 30-40% of eBPF performance
- macOS: Network Extension Framework - 15-20% of eBPF performance

*Note: For endpoint use cases (10-100 pkt/sec), even macOS performance is more than sufficient.*

### Multi-Level ML Detection

**Level 1: General Attack Detection**
- Model: Random Forest (23 features)
- Purpose: Classify traffic as benign vs attack
- Threshold: 65% confidence
- Latency: <1ms per event

**Level 2a: DDoS Binary Classification**
- Model: Random Forest (8 features)
- Purpose: Detect DDoS patterns specifically
- Threshold: 70% confidence
- Triggers: Only if Level 1 detects attack

**Level 2b: Ransomware Detection** *(Future)*
- Model: Random Forest (82 features)
- Purpose: Identify ransomware communication patterns
- Status: Model exists, integration pending

**Level 3: Anomaly Detection** *(Future)*
- Internal traffic analyzer (4 features)
- Web traffic analyzer (4 features)
- Purpose: Detect 0-day attacks via behavioral analysis

**Level 4: Advanced Threat Analysis** *(Vision)*
- Deep learning models for sophisticated attacks
- Federated learning from community (opt-in)
- Adaptive models that learn from your network

### Model Update & Verification System

**Update Pipeline:**
1. **Training** (your infrastructure):
    - Train on real attack datasets
    - Validate accuracy, false positive rate
    - Test for adversarial robustness
    - Sign with private key (GPG)

2. **Publishing:**
    - Upload to GitHub releases
    - Publish SHA256 hashes to multiple sources
    - Announce in community channels

3. **Client Download:**
    - Daily update check (user can disable)
    - Download new models + signature
    - Verify GPG signature + SHA256 hash
    - Test in **shadow mode** for 24 hours

4. **Shadow Mode Testing:**
    - New model runs in parallel with old
    - No impact on production decisions
    - Monitor false positive rate
    - If metrics degrade >10%, auto-rollback

5. **Promotion or Rollback:**
    - If shadow mode successful → promote
    - If issues detected → rollback + alert user
    - Old models archived for manual rollback

**User Control:**
```bash
# Check for updates manually
ml-defender update check

# Apply updates (with shadow mode)
ml-defender update apply

# Rollback to previous model
ml-defender update rollback

# Disable auto-updates (not recommended)
ml-defender config set auto_update false
```

## Principles for Decision Making

When faced with difficult choices, these principles guide us:

### 1. Privacy Over Profit
If a feature compromises user privacy, we don't build it. Even if it would make more money.

**Example:** We could sell aggregated attack data. We won't.

### 2. Transparency Over Convenience
If we can't make something auditable, we reconsider whether we need it.

**Example:** We could use a proprietary ML runtime for 10% better performance. We use open-source ONNX instead.

### 3. Accessibility Over Exclusivity
If only the wealthy can afford protection, we're failing. Security should be a right.

**Example:** We maintain a free, fully-functional open-source version even though a closed-source version would be easier to monetize.

### 4. Long-term Over Short-term
We're building for years, not months. Short-term compromises are avoided.

**Example:** We could ship faster with technical debt. We refactor properly instead.

### 5. Community Over Control
Users should have agency. If they want to modify, audit, or fork, they should be able to.

**Example:** AGPLv3 license ensures derivative work stays open.

## The Dream

This document started with a conversation about a system processing 10 packets per second in a virtual machine, barely breaking a sweat at 150MB of RAM.

That observation led to a realization: if this can run on a datacenter server processing 100,000 events per second, it can also run on a $35 Raspberry Pi protecting a home network.

And if it can do that, then security doesn't have to be a privilege. It can be a right.

We dream of a world where:
- A developer in Mumbai can protect their laptop with the same ML models that defend Fortune 500 companies
- A small business in rural America can afford enterprise-grade security for $149
- A privacy advocate can verify, audit, and trust their security system because it's open source
- IoT devices aren't vulnerable because they have 200MB of RAM to spare
- Grandparents can plug in a box and be protected from ransomware without understanding what ransomware is

This isn't a fantasy. The technology exists. The code is written. The models are trained.

What remains is the work:
- Refining the rough edges
- Building the user experience
- Creating the hardware
- Growing the community
- Proving the value
- Earning the trust

It's a long road. There will be obstacles. Technical challenges. Manufacturing problems. Support tickets. Competitors. Doubters.

But the foundation is solid. Built like the Via Appia: to last a thousand years.

## Closing Thoughts

From the creators:

*"We started this project to solve a technical problem: network security at scale. Along the way, we realized we were solving a human problem: security shouldn't be exclusive.*

*The system you're reading about doesn't exist yet as a product. It exists as code, as models, as a pipeline processing events. But the dream is real.*

*We're going to build this. Not because it's easy, but because it matters.*

*With humility, knowing we have much to learn.*

*With perseverance, knowing the road is long.*

*With hope, knowing that security for everyone is possible.*

*Day by day. Line by line. Packet by packet.*

*Via Appia quality. Built to last."*
