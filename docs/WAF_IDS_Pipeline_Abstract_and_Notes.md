## 🧠 Research Log

*(A living record of development, milestones, and lessons learned. Updated iteratively as the project evolves.)*

### October 2025 — Initial Concept Formation
- Defined the architectural convergence between the **WAF microservice** and **IDS pipeline**.
- Decision to create a **dedicated sniffer-ebpf-waf**, operating asynchronously to preserve performance of the main sniffer.
- Established the vision of a **dual-path acquisition system**, fusing features from both sniffers before ML inference.
- Agreement to maintain **two independent feature payloads**, later merged at classification time.
- Defined guiding philosophy: the system should emulate an **immune response** — detection, isolation, adaptation.

### Planned Next Steps
- Build prototype WAF sniffer in eBPF focusing on minimal HTTP/TLS metadata.
- Extend `promiscuous_agent` to tag events with origin context (WAF / Core IDS).
- Integrate asynchronous fusion layer and benchmark latency.
- Begin drafting experimental section for arXiv submission.

## Abstract

This document outlines the conceptual foundation for a next-generation **autonomous cyber defense pipeline**, integrating a **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** and **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** under a unified, AI-driven architecture.

The objective is to create a **self-adaptive, low-latency network protection fabric**, capable of detecting, contextualizing, and responding to cyber threats in real-time — evolving through continuous feedback and federated learning.

Unlike conventional systems, our approach emphasizes **biological analogy**, **distributed intelligence**, and **systemic cooperation** across modular microagents, aiming to emulate an **immune system** for the digital ecosystem.

## 1. Motivation and Vision

The exponential complexity of digital ecosystems has outpaced traditional security architectures. Static rulesets, manual tuning, and siloed WAF/IDS deployments cannot keep up with modern threats characterized by polymorphism, zero-day attacks, and adversarial behaviors.

This work aims to demonstrate that:
- **Autonomous agents**, guided by machine learning and eBPF-based introspection, can cooperatively defend network layers.
- **WAF-level micro-observation** can complement **IDS-level behavioral intelligence** to form a coherent, adaptive model.
- **Distributed learning** between nodes ensures resilience and reduces single points of failure.

Our philosophical stance:
> “Security should not be an afterthought, but an emergent property of adaptive systems.”

## 2. Technical Foundation

The proposed system builds upon a modular pipeline composed of:
- **eBPF-based Sniffers** for low-level, kernel-space packet feature extraction.
- **Promiscuous Agents** for enriched data aggregation (GeoIP, protocol analysis, entropy measures).
- **Supervised ML models (Random Forest, later Deep Hybrid Models)** for attack classification and anomaly characterization.
- **Fast Ejector Layer (FEL)** for real-time reaction: blocking, isolation, or honeypot redirection.
- **WAF microservice** specialized for high-frequency web-layer attacks (SQLi, RCE, LFI, SSRF, etc.) integrated asynchronously into the main inference pipeline.

### Design Philosophy:
1. **Dual-path acquisition**: `sniffer-ebpf` for deep system metrics + `sniffer-ebpf-waf` for HTTP/HTTPS-layer telemetry.
2. **Asynchronous fusion** of payloads before classification ensures scalability without latency trade-offs.
3. **Continuous learning loop** where validated alerts are fed back into training datasets.

### Infrastructure:
- Containerized microservices interconnected via **ZeroMQ**.
- Configuration via **declarative JSON schemas** (no hardcoded parameters).
- Secure inter-node communication (compression + optional encryption).
- Optional integration with **etcd** for shared key rotation and dynamic configuration.

## 3. Research Objectives

1. **Demonstrate low-latency integration** between WAF and IDS layers without compromising throughput.
2. **Establish a modular event schema** adaptable across diverse datasets and protocols.
3. **Evaluate model robustness** against synthetic and live attack scenarios.
4. **Benchmark resource impact** of concurrent eBPF agents under varying traffic loads.
5. **Develop open, reproducible tools** for future researchers and engineers.

## 4. Philosophical and Educational Value

While this work pursues rigorous scientific objectives, it also seeks to **inspire a new generation** of engineers.  
We emphasize *transparency, modularity,* and *curiosity* as the pillars of secure system design.

Each lesson learned — from packet timing to model drift — becomes part of a collective understanding of what it means for a machine to defend itself.

> “We build not only for performance, but for those who will build upon our work.”

## 5. Future Work

- Expansion to **federated training** across distributed nodes.
- Integration of **reinforcement learning agents** for dynamic firewall policy adaptation.
- Exploration of **neuro-symbolic reasoning** for explainable intrusion decisions.
- Creation of a **visual dashboard** for real-time introspection and human-in-the-loop tuning.
- Formal evaluation under **CICIDS2017**, **MAWI**, and **Stratosphere** datasets.

## Appendix: Notes for arXiv Paper Development

**Tone:**  
Balanced between scientific rigor and visionary narrative. The paper will bridge the gap between engineering practice and systemic design philosophy.

**Intended Audience:**  
Researchers, network engineers, AI practitioners, and educators in cybersecurity automation.

**Core Message:**
> A resilient, self-evolving defense system is possible when modular intelligence, observability, and cooperation are treated as first-class citizens.
