- 🟠 **4 features:** Lateral Movement (SMB scanning, RDP brute force)
- 🟡 **4 features:** Data Exfiltration (upload spikes, burst connections)

## 📊 Technical Decisions Made

### ✅ Architecture: Option C (Hybrid)
**Rationale:** Sniffer sends packets with flow_id → ML-Detector aggregates
- **Pro:** Balance between performance and flexibility
- **Pro:** Sniffer stays lightweight (4 MB RAM target)
- **Pro:** ML-Detector can tune windows without recompiling sniffer
- **Con:** Slightly more work in detector (acceptable tradeoff)

### ✅ Feature Count: 20 (not 83)
**Rationale:** Start lean, expand for enterprise
- **RPi version:** 20 features, <50 MB model
- **Enterprise version:** 83 features, <200 MB model (future)
- **Philosophy:** "Via Appia quality" - build incrementally, test thoroughly

### ✅ Detection Strategy: Multi-Layer
**Layer 1 (Critical):** C&C detection (features 1, 2, 7)  
→ Catches ransomware at initial infection (before encryption)

**Layer 2 (High Priority):** Lateral movement + exfiltration  
→ Catches ransomware during spreading phase

**Layer 3 (Polish):** Behavioral anomalies  
→ Reduces false positives

## 🚀 Next Steps - Priority Order

### IMMEDIATE (Do Today)

1. **Copy files to project:**
```bash
cd ~/CLionProjects/test-zeromq-docker

# Copy feature JSON
cp ransomware_20_features.json sniffer/config/features/

# Copy documentation
cp ransomware_20_features_design.md docs/
cp implementation_roadmap.md docs/
cp config_update_instructions.md docs/
```

2. **Update configs:**
```bash
# Follow instructions in config_update_instructions.md
# Updates sniffer.json: 83 -> 20 features
# Updates ml_detector_config.json: 82 -> 20 features
```

3. **Validate & commit:**
```bash
# Run validation script from config_update_instructions.md
# If all checks pass:
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: add ransomware detection features (20 critical)"
git tag -a v3.3.0-ransomware-features -m "Ransomware detection features v1.0"
```

4. **Verify build still works:**
```bash
make rebuild
make run-detector  # Terminal 1
make run-sniffer   # Terminal 2
# Should build cleanly (ransomware model not active yet)
```

2. Extract features from PCAPs (Python script)
3. Train RandomForest model
4. Validate: accuracy >95%, FPR <1%
5. Export to ONNX
6. Copy to `ml-detector/models/production/level2/`

**Expected output:**
- ✅ `ransomware_rf_20.onnx` model (<50 MB)
- ✅ Accuracy >95% on test set
- ✅ Inference time <500 µs

### WEEK AFTER (Phase 3: Integration)

**Goal:** End-to-end ransomware detection operational

**Tasks:**
1. Enable ransomware model in ml_detector_config.json
2. End-to-end testing with benign traffic (0 false positives)
3. End-to-end testing with ransomware samples (detect in <30s)
4. Performance testing under load
5. Tune thresholds if needed

**Expected output:**
- ✅ Full pipeline: Sniffer → ML-Detector → Ransomware alert
- ✅ Zero false positives on 24h benign traffic
- ✅ Detects WannaCry/Petya/NotPetya within 30 seconds
- ✅ Latency P99 <5ms

## 🏛️ Design Philosophy Applied

### "Via Appia Quality" - Built to Last
- ✅ **Single source of truth:** One feature definition in JSON
- ✅ **DRY principle:** No duplicate configs
- ✅ **Incremental:** 20 features now, 83 later
- ✅ **Testable:** Unit tests for each component
- ✅ **Documented:** Clear implementation notes

### "Make it Impossible to Fuck Up"
- ✅ **Validated configs:** JSON schema validation
- ✅ **Clear dependencies:** Each feature lists what it needs
- ✅ **Phase gates:** Can't proceed until previous phase passes tests
- ✅ **Rollback plan:** Can disable ransomware model anytime

### "Protect Real Businesses"
- ✅ **Detect BEFORE encryption:** Focus on C&C phase (features 1-6)
- ✅ **Low false positives:** <1% FPR target
- ✅ **Fast response:** <3ms detection-to-block budget (per Parallels.ai)
- ✅ **Resource constrained:** Works on Raspberry Pi

## 🎓 Key Insights from Research

### Why These 20 Features?

**Research-backed choices:**
1. **DNS entropy** - 90%+ accuracy for DGA detection (source: CTU-13 analysis)
2. **New external IPs** - Ransomware MUST contact C&C (unavoidable)
3. **SMB diversity** - WannaCry/Petya lateral movement signature
4. **Upload/download ratio** - Double-extortion ransomware tell
5. **Protocol diversity** - Ransomware uses SMB+HTTP+DNS+TLS simultaneously

**Evasion difficulty analysis:**
- **HARD to evade:** Features 1, 4, 7, 13, 17 (core behaviors)
- **MEDIUM difficulty:** Features 2, 3, 8, 9, 11, 16, 18, 19, 20
- **EASY to evade:** Features 6, 14, 15

**Strategy:** Combine hard-to-evade with medium-difficulty for 95%+ detection

### Parallels.ai Recommendations Applied

**From their report:**
- ✅ **Sub-3ms budget:** Allocated <500 µs for inference
- ✅ **XDP fast path:** Already using eBPF in sniffer
- ✅ **Multi-scale windows:** 30s (short), 300s (medium), 600s (long)
- ✅ **INT8 quantization:** For ONNX model (future optimization)
- ✅ **Fail-closed strategy:** If detector crashes, block all (future)

## 💭 Questions to Consider

Before starting implementation:

1. **Protobuf:** Do we need to add `RansomwareFeatures` message or reuse existing fields?
2. **eBPF limits:** Can we extract DNS payloads in kernel or user-space only?
3. **TLS inspection:** Self-signed cert detection - worth the complexity?
4. **Datasets:** Do you already have CTU-13 downloaded or need to get it?
5. **Testing environment:** Do you have a safe VM to replay ransomware PCAPs?

**Immediate action items:**
1. ✅ Copy 4 documents to project directory
